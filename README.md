# Fast Holographic Deconvolution (FHD)

FHD is an imaging algorithm for radio interferometers. It uses the full complex gain for every baseline for gridding, and pre-computes the uv-plane covariance matrix (the Holographic Mapping function). In its current implementation, FHD follows a centroided matched pursuit algorithm for deconvolving point sources. While FHD does not refer back to the visibilities once they have been gridded to a dirty image, it is still properly classified as a visibility-based subtraction algorithm since sources are forward-modeled through the mapping function. 

Aside from the basic use of snapshot imaging, there are a number of extensions that expand its capabilities. Most notably, FHD can perform a joint deconvolution of any set of visibilities by regridding each snapshot to a common HEALPix mesh. This allows for long integrations, and even for joint deconvolution of data from different instruments. Additionally, if snapshot observations share precisely the same beam models (these models can change over time and be different for each antenna, the observations must simply have the same change over time etc..), then the mapping function can be re-used between them. This allows for long integrations without an excessively large memory requirement, since the same mapping function can be used for each snapshot.

FHD is typically called by writing a script that is a wrapper for general_obs.pro. This script contains the full file paths to all of the uvfits files that will be used, the path to any ancillary catalog that will be used, and the desired paths where it will put the output. 

# Useful Resources

* FHD is run by specifying keywords in a wrapper that is passed to the main code. These keywords change the functionality of FHD for fine-tuning and flexibility. Please visit the `dictionary.md` file for keywords and their definitions.
* Some mathematical assumptions are built into the framework of FHD. Please visit the `assumptions.md` file (forthcoming!) to explore the parameter space.
* FHD can process data from a multitude of instrumentation. Please visit the `examples.md` file (forthcoming!) for brief tutorials on specific cases.

FHD is an imaging algorithm for radio interferometers.

A good example script for the 128T MWA is test_128t.pro

3 Commonly used commands

cleanup=0 ; Set to delete most of the .sav files when finished 

End_fi ; last file index of the supplied list to deconvolve (zero index)

export_images=1 ; If set, generate numerous output images and data files

Force_data; Force visibility data to be read from file, even if all the needed .sav files are already present

Force_no_data; Force visibility data to not be read from a file, even if needed.

grid_recalculate=recalculate_all ; recalculate (grid) the dirty images

mapfn_recalculate=recalculate_all ;recalculate the mapping function 

recalculate_all=1 ;All other ‘recalculate’ options default to recalculate_all

Silent ; suppress most status messages 

Skip_fi ; If supplied, skip the specified file index (may be a list)

Start_fi ; first file index of the supplied list to deconvolve (zero index) 

version=0 ; Add a version number to the output data directory. Used only in the top-level observation wrappers

vis_file_list ; Typically supplied by the observation wrapper. Can be a string array containing the full file paths of the uvfits files to deconvolve OR can be the filepath to a text file (must end .txt), which contains the full filepaths of the visibilities.


3b Calibration options

calibrate_visibilities ; Set to calculate new calibration solutions

calibration_catalog_file_path ; catalog of point sources to use for calibration

max_calibration_sources ; Maximum number of calibration sources to use from catalog

calibration_flux_threshold=0 ; Minimum source flux to use for calibration.

min_cal_baseline ; Minimum baseline length to use for calculating calibration solution
