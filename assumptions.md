# Assumptions <br />
There are some assumptions about the data that are inherent to FHD and its mathematical basis. Documented below are these assumptions and their consequences. <br />

## Time-based <br />

**Length of observations** <br />
PSFs are calculated only once per snapshot (ObsID). Sources will move through the beam over the course of a given snapshot, but the assumption is that the sky is stationary. This leads to small discontinuities visible in waterfall plots. Choose snapshots shorter than about 2 minutes to minimize the discontinuity between adjacent snapshots. Also, phase to the zenith at the center of the snapshot.

## W-projection <br />
Needs updated by Ian/Bryna/Miguel <br />

## Source catalog <br />
Spectral slope from one catalog, would be great if Patti could update <br />

## Cosmological <br />
Maybe Bryna can illuminate. <br />
