# Assumptions <br />
There are some assumptions about the data that are inherent to FHD and its mathematical basis. Documented below are these assumptions and their consequences. <br />

## Time-based <br />

**Length of observations** <br />
Needs updated by Adam L, who ran into a problem with too long obs <br />

## W-projection <br />
Needs updated by Ian/Bryna/Miguel <br />

## Source catalog <br />
Spectral slope from one catalog, would be great if Patti could update <br />

## Cosmological <br />
Maybe Bryna can illuminate. <br />
