# FHD Keyword Dictionary
FHD uses keywords to create unique run-specific settings. This dictionary describes the purpose of each keyword, as well as their logic or applicable ranges. Some keywords can override others, which is also documentated. The FHD default is listed when applicable, which can be overriden by EoR_firstpass settings in the top-level script eor_firstpass_version.pro.

This is a work in progress; please add keywords as you find them in alphabetical order with their corresponding definition. If there's a question about a definition or keyword, label it with !Q.

## Beam

**beam_model_version**: a number that indicates the tile beam model calculation. This is dependent on the instrument, and specific calculations are carried out in `<instrument>_beam_setup_gain.pro`. For the MWA, there are currently three options: 0) !Q, 1) a Hertzian dipole as prescribed by Cheng 1992 and Balanis 1989 (!Q Ian, dipole looks flipped from what Sutinjo has in paper?), 2) the average embedded element model from Sutinjo 2015. For PAPER, there are currently two options: 1) !Q, 2) !Q. For HERA, there is currently one option: !Q. <br />
  -*EoR_firstpass settings*: 2 <br />
  -*Default*: 1 <br />
  -*MWA range*: 0, 1 (or anything else captured in the `else` statement), 2 <br />
  -*PAPER range*: 1 (or anything else captured in the `else` statement), 2 <br />
  -*HERA range*: automatically defaults <br />

**beam_offset_time**: calculate the beam at a specific time within the observation. 0 seconds indicates the start of the observation, and the # of seconds in an observation indicates the end of the observation. <br />
  -*EoR_firstpass settings*: 56 <br />
  -*Default*: 0 <br />
  -*Range*: 0-# of seconds in an observation <br />

**complex_beam**: !Q <br />
  -*Default*: 1 <br />

**dipole_mutual_coupling_factor**: allows a modification to the beam as a result of mutual coupling between dipoles calculated in `mwa_dipole_mutual_coupling.pro` (See Sutinjo 2015 for more details). <br />
  -*Needs updating*: calculation is done for the MWA setup, even if a different instrument is being used if `dipole_mutual_coupling_factor` is set. Needs to have an extra check !Q<br />
  -*Turn off/on*: 0/1 <br />
  -*EoR_firstpass settings*: 1 <br />
  -*Default*: 1 <br />

**nfreq_avg**: the number of fine frequency channels to calculate a beam for, using the average of the frequencies. The beam is a function of frequency, and a calculation on the finest level is most correct (nfreq_avg=1). However, this is computationally difficult for most machines. <br />
  -*EoR_firstpass settings*: 16 <br />
  -*Default*: 1 <br />
  -*Range*: 1-# of frequency channels, as long as it evenly divides the # of frequency channels <br />
  
**psf_resolution** : !Q

  -*EoR_firstpass settings*: 150 <br />
  -*Default*: 150 !Q <br />

  -*EoR_firstpass settings*: 1 <br />

If `model_visibilities` is set to 0, then the calibration model visibilities and the model visibilities will be the same if `return_cal_visibilities` is set. If `model_visibilities` is set to 1, then any new modelling (of more sources, diffuse, etc.) will take place and the visibilities created for the calibration model will be added. <br />

  -*EoR_firstpass settings*: 1 <br />
  -*Default*: 1 !Q <br />

(Which formats is the gain array expected in for these file types? !Q). Note that this will calibrate, but not generate a model. <br />
  -*Needs updating*: will not generate a model for subtraction in the current setup. <br />
  -*EoR_firstpass settings*: not set <br />
  -*Default*: not set <br />

  -*EoR_firstpass settings*: not set <br />
  -*Default*: not set<br />
  
**sim_noise**: add a uncorrelated thermal noise to the input dirty visibilities from a specified sav file, or create them for the run. <br />

  -*Default*: not set<br />
  

## Model

**allow_sidelobe_model_sources**: allows FHD to model sources in the sidelobes for subtraction. Forces the beam_threshold to 0.01 in order to go down to 1% of the beam to capture sidelobe sources during the generation of amodel alibration source catalog for the particular observation. <br />
  -*Dependency*: `model_visibilities` must be set to 1 in order for the keyword to take effect. <br />

  -*EoR_firstpass settings*: not set <br />

This is useful if the user sets keywords to make the subtraction model different from the model used in calibration. If not set, the model used for calibration is the same as the subtraction model. <br />
  -*Turn off/on*: 0/1 <br />
  -*EoR_firstpass settings*: 0 <br />

  -*Default*: not set <br />  

**flag_dead_dipoles**: flag the dead dipoles listed in `<instrument>_dead_dipole_list.txt` for the golden set of Aug 23, 2013. This greatly increases memory usage due to the creation of many separate tile beams. <br />

  -*Default*: 116.67081524 (MWA, from Tingay et al. 2013)<br />

  -*Turn off/on*: 0/1 <br />
  -*EoR_firstpass settings*: 1 <br />
  -*Default*: 0 <br />

  -*Default*: not set<br />

**override_target_phasedec**: dec of the target phase center, which overrides the value supplied in the metafits under the header keyword DECPHASE. If the metafits doesn't exist, it ovverides the value supplied in the uvfits under the header keyword Dec.<br />
  -*Default*: not set<br />
  
**rephase_weights**: if turned off, target phase center is the pointing center (as defined by Cotter). Setting rephase_weights=0 overrides override_target_phasera and override_target_phasedec. <br />
  -*Turn off/on*: 0/1 <br />
  -*Default*: 1 <br />


## Import

**uvfits_version**: the version number of the uvfits. `eor_firstpass_versions.pro` will use this keyword in conjuction with `uvfits_subversion` to query the mwa_qc database to find the location of the uvfits file on the MIT cluster. See `uvfits_subversion` for the current uvfits versions available. <br />
  -*Range*: currently 3 to 5 <br />
  -*EoR_firstpass settings*: 4 <br />

**uvfits_subversion**: the subversion number of the uvfits. `eor_firstpass_versions.pro` will use this keyword in conjuction with `uvfits_version` to query the mwa_qc database to find the location of the uvfits file on the MIT cluster. Here are the available uvfits versions, ordered by version number and subversion number: 3,3 was used to test compressed fits; 3,4 was a rerun of 3,1 with a newer version of cotter before that version was recorded; 4,0 went back to old settings for an industrial run; 4,1 was the same as 4,0 but for running on compressed gpubox files; 5,0 was a test to phase all obs to zenith (phasing needs to be added per obs currently); 5,1 incorperates flag files and runs cotter without the bandpass applied, with all the other default settings. Many of these uvfits versions were removed for space reasons, and so only 4,1 and 5,0 are reliable.<br />
  -*Range*: currently 0 to 4 <br />
  -*EoR_firstpass settings*: 1 <br />


## Recalculation

**recalculate_all**: forces FHD to recalculate all values instead of reading in save files. This is the same as setting `mapfn_recalculate`, `healpix_recalculate` , ... to 1. <br />

  -*Default*: 2 to the power of the rounded result of log&#8322;(k_span/k_binsize).<br />

**kbinsize**: size of UV pixels in wavelengths. Given a defined number of pixels in `dimension`, this sets the UV space extent. This will supersede `degpix` if `dimension` is also set. <br />

  -*EoR_firstpass settings*: 0.5 <br />
  -*Default*: 0.5 if `FoV` not set !Q <br />

  -*EoR_firstpass settings*: 0 <br />
  -*Default*: not set <br />

**max_baseline**: the maximum baseline length in wavelengths to include in the analysis. <br />
